Hello! This was a project that I wanted to start working on for a long time. I'm in love with Pokemon, 
data science, and software engineering so I thought it would be great if I could incorporate all of those things
in one project! In this repository there are web scrappers, a mongodb gui application, and some machine learning
iPython notebooks. I learned a lot from my initial work with this project and it is only the beginning! In the future,
I plan on making more web scrappers to generate more data to put into my database and to do some learning on.
