I have to admit that I am a little obsessed about Pokemon (It is the greatest game in existence). Because of my obsession, I decided it would be a lot of fun to create a series of programs that centered around my favorite game. In Phase 1 of my project, I made some web scrappers, and a MongoDB GUI application to provide an user interface to mess with my data; furthermore, I conducted unsupervised learning on the data that I amassed from the scrappers. In Phase 2, I made a binary image classifier using a Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) to decipher if an image is of a pokemon or not. I then made a GUI application with the trained model. they were all created using Python. This is going to be a long project (since it has many smaller projects), and a lot more will be added to it! Future plans: start Phase 3 using Twitter as a means of data for text analysis, sentiment analysis, and Natural Language Processing using the new programming Language Julia, reinforce the SVM model, implement a multiclass image classifier using deep learning (by means of the Tensorflow library).
